Do you support restricting firearms purchases to people age 21 or over?  No, age is not necessarily equivalent to maturity.	Do you support banning accessories like bump stocks &amp; trigger cranks that make a semi-auto firearm fire much faster?  No (due to principle).
Do you support banning accessories like bump stocks &amp; trigger cranks that make a semi-auto firearm fire much faster?  No (due to principle).	@0xdeadbabe Eh?  Bump stocks are automatic weapons.  I don't see why we should allow low-quality machine guns but disallow well-designed ones.  Both should be restricted to dealers/ranges/etc.
Do you support banning accessories like bump stocks &amp; trigger cranks that make a semi-auto firearm fire much faster?  No (due to principle).	Do you support limiting velocity of firearms (about 3000 feet per second for an AR-15) to reduce lethality/damage of hits?  No (and the question is a bit silly).
@EdKrassen ONLY if you have a permit. And to get that you need to apply for it. You need to get fingerprinted, have a BG check, and a doctor to sign off on you. Anyone that has a history of DUIs, history of serious psychiatric diagnosis, or any treatment for alcohol 1/x	@EdKrassen ... can‚Äôt get a permit. It takes 14 days for you to get your permit once you apply. So yeah, you can buy an AR-15 in Hawaii... IF you can get a permit for it. 2/2

If you come into my mentions with that ‚Äúdefense against invasion‚Äù bullshit I‚Äôll laugh you out of there.	@157Gale The AR-15 is the boogeyman of the gun world because it looks tactical. The reality is it's used because it's cheap. Get rid of the AR-15 and there's still endless choices of semi automatic rifles available.

Broward sheriff's office got at least 18 calls about Nikolas Cruz from 2008-17.  11/30/17: caller said he was a school shooter in the making and that he was collecting guns and knives.  What a tragic systematic failure.  #NeverAgain #BanAssaultWeapons https://t.co/2uHEKdEBFC	@13thDoctor2018 See.  If there had been a ban on assault weapons or even an age increase on purchases they could have arrested him on one of those calls. IF they had been illegal.  So when they say making them illegal wouldn't stop the bad guys, it's a nonsensical argument.  #BanAssaultWeapons
@LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig Why do they need AR-15 and any guns like it? What are they hunting????	@1005Mike @LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig The only game animal I know of that an AR-15 is suitable for is feral hogs. And even then they say the AK is a better choice, less likely to jam if the hog charges. Feral hogs are the only animal that hunters would use full-auto if they could. They are ecological disasters.
@LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig Why do they need AR-15 and any guns like it? What are they hunting????	@1005Mike @LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig An AR-15 is no more effective than a hand gun at close to medium range, this is why virtually all shootings are carried out by handguns. Beyond that, a bump stock is a novelty item, it makes accuracy so ad that likely 95%+ of your shots will miss whatever you aim at.

@Hertz Thank you for choosing children‚Äôs lives over corporate interests.  You are on the good side of history. ‚ù§Ô∏è	@11donofrio @Hertz I rely on my AR-15 to defend my family against home invaders.  Why do you want my children to be more vulnerable to rape and murder?

I wish I was an NRA member so I could quit! Damn  I switched to the Democratic Party in December. I never was a Republican at heart, but being from a RED ASS State, I was a registered REP so I could vote in the Primaries for the worst candidate.   #NeverAgain  #BoycottFedEx https://t.co/o4bdU7MuyB	@14countries I quit when LaPierre took over. When they get rid of him, stop the fear mongering and get out of politics, I may go back.  #NeverAgain
JUST IN | Dick's Sporting Goods bans sales of assault weapons, gun sales to people under 21 https://t.co/p2PbFKF5hI https://t.co/2ajOt30pSz	@10NewsWTSP Dishonest title since assault weapons are already banned. They are banning the sale of semi-automatic weapons that look scary and have very little difference with handguns. Liberal media wins again.

@NegusHamitic @teamtrace Do the police release all records to the public on these call outs?  Not trying to be factious or anything, just not aware of them doing this.  But then again, I don‚Äôt live in Florida.	@093401Ramsey @teamtrace * Ensure States are providing records to the background check system, and work cooperatively with jurisdictions to improve reporting https://t.co/nC9yaHmNjJ

But then again, I don‚Äôt live in Florida.	@093401Ramsey @teamtrace I believe that children's bargaining power with a Federal government,that refuses to protect them,from bullets entering their body, is to refuse to military serve,for a country that puts little to no value on their lives or their futures. They say #NeverAgainMSD,then #neveragain

Nope disagree they want you to see they because they both think that bump stocks should be illegal and banned https://t.co/1UOPSpkhmi	@03Javi03 A bump stock is no different than a belt loop or shoe string.  Banning it is a feel good measure. As all bans are. Criminals don't care about bans...or laws. But keep piling them on innocent ppl.

From a FB acquaintance:    A high school aged cousin of mine just posted this ‚Äúlet‚Äôs change the name from ‚Äúschool‚Äù to ‚Äúuterus‚Äù and then maybe republicans will do something about the children dying inside them.‚Äù Sad, but true statement.   #NRAKills #ParklandShooting	@13WJM Please google #AlexaMiednik. She is in extreme danger for speaking of her conversation with Cruz WHILE shots were being fired. #MainStreamMedia WILL NOT REPLAY HER STORY. WAKE UP! CRUZ WAS MENTALLY DISTURBED AND THE CIA MENTALLY PUSHED HIM. #MKULTRA #ParklandShooting #NicolasCruz

I've been told that here in Australia, we don't have quite as much freedom as you as you do in the USA, but we do have one freedom that you don't.  That's the freedom to send our kids to school and not worrying that there will be a mass shooting.	@14minutetwit We also apparently have the unfettered right to buy an assault rifle and do with it as we please not matter how batsh*t crazy, angry or mentally ill we are. Tragic that so many doing so desire to kill innocent strangers, including kids, for the full NRA inspired ‚Äújoy‚Äù of it.
The Dallas Police shooter killed five police officers with an assault rifle.   The Baton Rouge shooter killed three police officers with an assault rifle.  What in the hell makes you think that arming teachers is going to stop a bad guy with an assault rifle in a school?	@12thMax In every case the shooter either stopped shooting or at least because a far less effective shooter when there was return fire.   Shall we remember the Sutherland Springs church shooting were an AR-15 in the hands of a citizen STOPPED the mass shooting?
WATCH: Meeting with students, Pres. Trump discusses the idea of arming teachers &amp; educators. https://t.co/N4omQYuiOk #11MSNBC https://t.co/ntBnglPpRN	@11thHour Arming teachers with guns is as ridiculous an idea as it was to propose airline pilots carry firearms after 9/11.  They‚Äôre busy and focused on their job...not on some fool running through the door with an assault rifle.

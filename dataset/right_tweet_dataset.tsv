Democrats mislead  with the word Assault Rifle. When you say Assault weapon it makes it sound like these are the same machine guns used in the military, but that's not true. These are semi automatic weapons that use the same ammo as hand guns. 1 bullet per trigger-pull. #NRA	@1776Stonewall @pedsscrub The AR-15's a semi-automatic rifle that fires 45-60 rounds per minute. But, for as little as $99, you can buy a bump stock that will let the AR-15 fire 600 rpm.  That's unexeceptable!  BTW: Technically, there's no such thing as an assault rifle(aka combat rifle).#GunControlNow

This is the fourth school shooting in a MONTH AND A HALF. If we can't talk about gun control now, then when? When??? WHEN??????

The United States Army defines an assault rifle as having select fire.  Which means you can choose between single shot and fully automatic.  Some assault rifles have burst fire as well.  This is why the AR 15 is not an assault rifle.  This is just a fact.	The assault rifle fires ammunition that is more powerful then a pistol but LESS powerful then long range rifles.  The civilian versions are not weapons of war, we have hunting rifles that are significantly more powerful.
Bump stocks became legal under Obama. Democrats defended hom, said that there was nothing that Obama could have done to prevent that. But Trump says that he can get rid of it with an executive order. So knowing that, wouldn't you say that Obama is partially responsible for Vegas?	@1776Stonewall Pure speculation on my part, but I believe anyone who has ever fired an AR-15 with a ‚Äúbump stock‚Äù on it would tell you that there were likely less casualties because the shooter used one.  I‚Äôm not defending that POS obama, I‚Äôm pissed the slide fire is being banned for no reason.

Florida Gun law.... 18 to purchase a Shotgun or Rifle and 21 to purchase hand gun.  I'm sorry, where I live it is 21 to purchase a Rifle or handgun. You can own a shotgun at age 18.

#BoycottNRA ????? You have to be a member you idiots.	@1776Stonewall Nope. You can contribute by boycotting all of their business partners (you know, like @FedEx &amp; @amazon &amp; @TrueCar ) &amp; by helping other people understand what businesses are friendly to them so that we can stop the flow of #NRABloodMoney to politicians by costing them money.

The answer to school shootings isn't less guns in school, it's more guns. you will NEVER stop all lone wolf madmen who decide to kill people. you're not going to get illegal guns off the streets, we've tried that for years. We need armed guards, ex-military, in every school	@1776Stonewall @FedUpSpeakinUp Surely some teachers have concealed carry permits?  Isnt that an option in the US?  I mean you already trust teachers with your children so surely that would work over there?

Take Chicago, any week of any year.  Criminals get guns regardless,  and the gun free zone is like shooting fish in a barrel.

#BoycottNRA This # it‚Äôs so stupid   The NRA does more to promote safety than the Liberals have in 50 years. The NRA represents training, responsibility, commonsense, and our Constitution.  Of course the liberals hate it.	@6bird4 I will not boycott the NRA I am a member of the NRA and proud of it. My father was an NRA member, our family is NRA members. Our two boys that are 38 and 36 are both NRA members we have firearms  They are teaching ourgrandkids about firearms safety.I blame the FBI/ security guard
Congressional candidate @ShaneTHazel makes a valid point.  If #Democrats think that #Trump is literally Hitler, why are they so eager to turn over guns to his admin? https://t.co/zvykjjhmOj	@2018NVPolitics @ShaneTHazel Basically, if the Jewish population (along with the LGBT, the gypsies, etc.) practiced the #2a in the 1930s, Hitler‚Äôs ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù party would had suffered a blow in politics, European influence, and military dominance.

#GunReformNow People in the US have had guns in their homes for over 200 years. And mass shootings have only become a major problem in the last 30 years.

The fault belongs to manufacturers, who don‚Äôt care a/b making child-proof products, and politicians, who neglect to protect us through #GunReformNow

Bump stocks were not ‚Äúmade legal‚Äù‚Äôduring the Obama administration rather the current law did not permit them to block or outlaw them. Because bump sticks do not alter the gun‚Äôs internal mechanisms, they could not be regulated under current law.

I'm sure the mislead kids in the rallies don't know that though.	@1776Stonewall Please don't mislead or mischaracterize. While the 2010 letter said that bump stock were allowed, this was because the ATF saw that nothing in current legislation was written that required their regulation.

Bump stocks aren't actual firearms, so the ATF ruled they didn't have the authority to regulate them in 2010. They were approved in 2003, Obama didn't blame Bush for it.

@Star8400CPD @Loduv @GIJoeOPS Just to add... 67% of gun murders are committed by people armed with pistols. Less than 2% with an AR-15	@65Collector @Loduv @GIJoeOPS YOU ARE CORRECT SIR. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THE POINT I WAS MAKING. A WELL-TRAINED PERSON WITH A HANDGUN CAN,WITH A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, DEFEAT/DISRUPT AN ATTACKER WITH AN AR-15.
The FBI was warned about threats made by the Parkland shooter.   The shooter passed a Federal background check &amp; purchased the gun legally.   People saw something &amp; said something. Nothing happened.   The gov‚Äôt is the problem, not gun carrying law abiding citizens.  #GunReformNow	@211Pine #FBIGate &amp;  #Parkland school lapse in proper entry locks &amp; security (which most schools have), and lack of reporting shooter to the authorities upon expulsion... = Civilly liable for 17 deaths.

They are trying to have a real conversation on school safety on #TheFive , but all Juan Williams wants to do is attack Trump and the NRA. I mean holy shit!

@SkyNewsBreak What did the NRA have to do with the #FloridaSchoolShooting?  * School knew he was dangerous. * Police knew he was dangerous. * FBI received tips stating he was dangerous.

It‚Äôs very telling that you conveniently left out the ‚Äúeasy access to an AR-15‚Äù part.  It was part of your blame game equation.  It mattered.

So Trump said he wants to take the guns first from dangerous people, like Cruz, who shouldn't have guns, and really shouldn't even be on the streets. and people are upset about this? If you're not a mentally deranged person, with a 10 page rap sheet, you're in the clear.	@1776Stonewall @EliadDagan I('m a staunch #2ndAmendmentRights person. I don't like the push to 21 before you can buy long gun, but mentally ill and criminals should definitely be prohibited (as felons are at this time - but it of course they break law anyway) #NikolasCruz should have had criminal record!!!

Just call in a false and malicious complaint. How hard and expensive will it be for that person to clear themselves and get their weapon(s) back? I still believe in innocent UNTIL PROVEN guilty! #2A

Assault weapon is a term made up by politicians. https://t.co/OzbkILjRbz	@1rightwife How STUPIDITY RUNS WILD IN AMERICA. THIS IGNORANT uninformed person don't realize that the term ASSAULT WEAPONS  IS ACTUALLY THE Name given to MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS DESIGNED FOR MASS KILLING. AR15 IS AN ASSAULT WEAPON. DON'T TRY TO POLITICIZE THE FACTS.
AR-15's didn't exsist when the founding fathers wrote the constitution.  The consitution wasn't written for a SINGLE time period, it was written to WITHSTAND the test of times.  Guns aren't going anywhere. #SorryNotSorry	@4uConservatives Puckle gun (1718)  They were trying VERY hard to create the AR.  If you went back in time, Gave Gen Washington the AR...

Dear @SenBillNelson... you grew up as a farmer and I grew up with a brain.  You cannot fold an AR-15--with or without a chainsaw bayonet--in half and hide it in your pants.

Isn't it amazing that the liberals at the CNN Town Hall attacked Dana Loesch, who has absolutely nothing to do with the shooting, but gave the Broward County Sheriff, a man who was directly responsible for their friends/family death,  a round of applauds?	@1776Stonewall It's truly mind blowing. I mean they went after @DLoesch like pitbulls for NOTHING. #NRA has zero to do with Parkland.

Most are always connected to those that support #GunControl, wonder why that is?
@K_Greenshield9 @NateMIvy @BetoORourke Not good, man - there is no such thing as an AR-15 that's automatic. The automatic equivalent is an M4 or M16. Both are ILLEGAL for civilians to own. UGH, get educated people!	@AaronHenager1 @NateMIvy @BetoORourke can‚Äôt help myself I need to hear your response, but automatic isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs being argued here. It wasn‚Äôt an auto weapon used in Parkland. It‚Äôs the assault rifle itself or whatever nomenclature you wanna give, it‚Äôs still a high powered weapon meant for killing, not sport

Trying your luck at another topic?  ArmaLite developed the AR-15 in the late 50's as a military rifle.  In the 60s the rifle was sold to Colt, and used in the Vietnam war as the m-16.  So, it is by definition an assault rifle - here endith the lesson...

Rush Limbaugh had a great session on how Democrats use children after a tragedy, who are already brainwashed liberals, and give the grieving kids a platform to speak out, and insist that politics stay out of it. but of course what the kids have to say is pure liberal propaganda	And they do it in a way that you can NEVER disagree with the grieving children, and if you do, than you are a disgusting insensitive sub-human. So We must listen to the children here - the children who are completely brainwashed liberals to begin with

@NeverTrumpTexan @JessieJaneDuff @usmcdoordie You (Never Trumper) are to the @GOP, what an AR15 is to a Marine...useless.   When a civilian pulls the trigger of an AR15, ONE round comes out.

But because it‚Äôs black and looks militaristic you digress. #MAGA https://t.co/bMLPO4NYSE	@4AllSoulKind @NeverTrumpTexan @JessieJaneDuff @usmcdoordie @GOP I have read from several reliable sources now that the usual and prefered method of fire for US military  from an M-4, or similar cailber of rifle ,  is semi-auto,  outside of that is very   selective usage.   So an AR-15 with same ammo........do the math

So, while not the same weapon, the AR15 is far deadlier than a typical handgun. Each round imparts greater energy and more likely to destroy organs.

@Catheri71000729 i get that, but then boycott the companies. you can't boycott the NRA	@1776Stonewall @Catheri71000729 Folks are asking companies to cut ties/boycott the NRA. It's working.
@Catheri71000729 i get that, but then boycott the companies. you can't boycott the NRA	@1776Stonewall @Catheri71000729 That's what it is - asking sponsors &amp; partners to end relationship with NRA or they'll be boycotted. #boycottNRA is just the hashtag that took off. More precisely it's #boycottcompaniesthatsupportNRA, but that takes up too many of our precious Twitter characters.

Take the guns first, go through due process second.
We've had gun free societies before, and they were terrible for women. taking guns away from people, especially women and older men, would take away their only means of defense, especially if they live alone	@1776Stonewall I know my wife travels with no fear when she's with me ccw man,she is waiting for her final criminal check and then she won't ever have to worry.

This is just fast-food arguments from #NRA ideology. Remember, it's not about #2A but about the financial interests of #NRA. #GunControlNow

Likewise, the implication that a 9mm handgun would be useless against an AR15 in a close quarters combat is a dubious argument at best. Combined with proper training, the element of surprise, and ferocity of defense, a 9mm can be as formidable as any other weapon. 6/	So please spare us the unrealistic political rhetoric, @SenFeinstein . It may work for the uneducated, but its deemed an embarrassment to our nation when it comes out of a supposed educated lawmaker. #2A #NRA End/

@Chrisvega25 @VP @POTUS Prayer can do anything	@aAmberDMc @Chrisvega25 @VP @POTUS Amber, could you please pray for Congress to have the courage to change laws concerning AR-15 assault style weapons? My prayers haven't been effective so far. Maybe yours are better than mine.
#BoycottNRA A gun ban would be as useless as prohibition. Trying to strip the rights of law abiding citizens isn't the answer. Over 2,000 teenagers died last year in alcohol related car accidents; where's the liberal outcry for stricter alcohol regulations?	@4TheSouls no where in the 2nd Amendment does it say you need (or even have a right to own) an AR-15.

WATCH: Meeting with students, Pres. Trump discusses the idea of arming teachers &amp; educators. https://t.co/N4omQYuiOk #11MSNBC https://t.co/ntBnglPpRN	@11thHour Arming teachers with guns is as ridiculous an idea as it was to propose airline pilots carry firearms after 9/11.  They‚Äôre busy and focused on their job...not on some fool running through the door with an assault rifle.
@cjchivers @bealejonathan I have said this before, and will say it again - there is no conceivable reason why a military grade firearm should be made available to the public to purchase openly. Unbelievable that this can happen (not withstanding the whole gun control issue)	@09EA63 @cjchivers @bealejonathan So, for those who do not know guns. the AR-15 is NOT A MIL SPEC weapon. And Military grade as you used here is a worthless marketing term that STILL does not apply to the weapon. Can you at least do the BASIC amount of research?
@LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig Why do they need AR-15 and any guns like it? What are they hunting????	@1005Mike @LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig It‚Äôs either an AR-15 or a t-shirt saying ‚ÄúI have a small one‚Äù. It‚Äôs that simple. https://t.co/PCtQrrrt6z

@Hertz Thank you for choosing children‚Äôs lives over corporate interests.  You are on the good side of history. ‚ù§Ô∏è	@11donofrio @Hertz I rely on my AR-15 to defend my family against home invaders.  Why do you want my children to be more vulnerable to rape and murder?

Nope disagree they want you to see they because they both think that bump stocks should be illegal and banned https://t.co/1UOPSpkhmi	@03Javi03 Who needs a bump stock.. https://t.co/JTSoedKscb
@ramin_parsa Your apprehension is understandable, but it doesn't have to be that way.

@NegusHamitic @teamtrace Do the police release all records to the public on these call outs?  Not trying to be factious or anything, just not aware of them doing this.

@FoxNews @williamlegate @BillClinton If banning assault weapons has even a small chance of curbing horror, why not take the chance?	@1212Colorado @FoxNews @williamlegate @BillClinton ‚ÄúBanning assault weapons‚Äù must include confiscation, not just stopping manufacturing as the 1994 law did. Do we, as a nation, support mandatory confiscation of certain guns? That‚Äôs a huge step beyond stopping sales.

@LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig Why do they need AR-15 and any guns like it? What are they hunting????	@1005Mike @LawDavisito94 @B52Malmet @ZacksJerryRig The only game animal I know of that an AR-15 is suitable for is feral hogs. And even then they say the AK is a better choice, less likely to jam if the hog charges. Feral hogs are the only animal that hunters would use full-auto if they could. They are ecological disasters.

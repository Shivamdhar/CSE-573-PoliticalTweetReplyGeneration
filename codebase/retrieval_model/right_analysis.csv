right,right,1.0,@1776Stonewall @clark7950 Yes but muzzle velocity and magazine size make it more lethal than a 9mm. If we say NCruz should've been screened, what do we mean?

We need clarification from @NRA #NRA.,@1776Stonewall @clark7950 Yes but muzzle velocity and magazine size make it more lethal than a 9mm. If we say NCruz should've been screened, what do we mean?

Democrats mislead  with the word Assault Rifle. When you say Assault weapon it makes it sound like these are the same machine guns used in the military, but that's not true. These are semi automatic weapons that use the same ammo as hand guns. 1 bullet per trigger-pull. #NRA	@1776Stonewall @DonnaArchibal12 One of my favorite assault weapons is a nicely rounded river rock.
Why does Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson keep lying about the AR-15 used in the Parkland shooting?   And @CNN why don’t you correct him? This is fake news!  It was NOT an automatic weapon &amp; anybody can’t just buy an automatic weapon.  Who can take these people serious?!  #GunReformNow https://t.co/zUCuf6UISK	@211Pine @CNN Seriously! It's a joke! And if you want to buy a gun you have to go through a background check and can't buy one if convicted of a felony, have a DUI, have a restraining order. These things are all controlled by the ATF of the federal government.

AR-15 are much harder to conceal then a hand gun  which can rip off as many rounds as an AR-15 in same time frame . Reloading is faster on handguns . My Glock 17 is semi -automatic like AR-15

Meaning if you post on facebook that you want to shoot up a school, called the cops on yourself, and the cops are at your house daily	@1776Stonewall Due process is for everyone.  Not just people you or the someone in govt thinks is crazy.  When govt defines the limits of your liberty, then all liberty is lost. That fact cannot be denied as history proves it true every day.

Carried one for next 15 years as I traveled by myself through rough neighborhoods to work. Only stopped when my Corporation said No weapons on campus. But I sure have it at home if I need it!
The NRA has never killed anyone, ever. Planned Parenthood kills people every single day. And don't tell me they're not people. they can survive out of the womb at 20-24 weeks. late term abortions are done daily. Before you speak, you should watch videos of this. #CPAC	@1776Stonewall @NRA days are over!  It’s an org that is going to flame out.

I'm sure the mislead kids in the rallies don't know that though.	@1776Stonewall The bump stock was submitted to ATF as a gun modifier for use by someone with a hand disability.  By the way - the weapon of choice for MS13 is a machete. But hey - maybe facts don't matter?

Bump stocks became legal under Obama. Democrats defended hom, said that there was nothing that Obama could have done to prevent that. But Trump says that he can get rid of it with an executive order. So knowing that, wouldn't you say that Obama is partially responsible for Vegas?	@1776Stonewall How is obama responsible for vegas? Paddock could have gotten a bump stock illegally as well.

So Trump said he wants to take the guns first from dangerous people, like Cruz, who shouldn't have guns, and really shouldn't even be on the streets. and people are upset about this?

(So if someone says you are unstable @1776Stonewall is that enough to have your guns taken away?) 2) Said NO to Republicans are CC reciprocity 3) Championed Obama style 2013 gun control.
Likewise, the implication that a 9mm handgun would be useless against an AR15 in a close quarters combat is a dubious argument at best. Combined with proper training, the element of surprise, and ferocity of defense, a 9mm can be as formidable as any other weapon. 6/	So please spare us the unrealistic political rhetoric, @SenFeinstein . It may work for the uneducated, but its deemed an embarrassment to our nation when it comes out of a supposed educated lawmaker. #2A #NRA End/

People act like banning guns is an easy thing to do. 80% of gun violence is gang related, and most gangsters have illegal guns. If it were so easy to take them away, then why do they still have them. In reality, the only people's guns you'd be taking are law abiding citizens	@1776Stonewall Not ban guns just a big assault rifles that shoot out round after round that are big enough to kill an elephant or rhinoceros.

Congressional candidate @ShaneTHazel makes a valid point.  If #Democrats think that #Trump is literally Hitler, why are they so eager to turn over guns to his admin? https://t.co/zvykjjhmOj	@2018NVPolitics @ShaneTHazel Basically, if the Jewish population (along with the LGBT, the gypsies, etc.) practiced the #2a in the 1930s, Hitler’s “socialist” party would had suffered a blow in politics, European influence, and military dominance.
#bumpstocks were made legal during the Obama Administration. isn't that ironic? And it is used by gangs like MS13. So if Trump gets rid of them, he will have done more than Obama did in 8 years. I'm sure the mislead kids in the rallies don't know that though.	@1776Stonewall @Ravenwhimsy And how does the administration plan to get those bump stocks out of the hands of criminals, I wonder? So if they make them illegal to own, some law abiding citizens will obey the law, but how does the govt plan to force criminals to do so?

#BoycottNRA does nothing to the NRA. Actually it's helped them, as they have picked up 10's of thousands of new members today.

So Trump said he wants to take the guns first from dangerous people, like Cruz, who shouldn't have guns, and really shouldn't even be on the streets. and people are upset about this? If you're not a mentally deranged person, with a 10 page rap sheet, you're in the clear.	@1776Stonewall We have laws to cover due process and preventing mentally incompetent from owning weapons I suggest they follow them and enforce them. But to suggest taking guns before due process is met is simply un-Constitutional.
People act like banning guns is an easy thing to do. 80% of gun violence is gang related, and most gangsters have illegal guns. If it were so easy to take them away, then why do they still have them. In reality, the only people's guns you'd be taking are law abiding citizens	@1776Stonewall OBAMBAS MS-13 &amp; BLACK LIVES MATTERS CREW.   IS THE ONLY ONE'S HE CARES ABOUT AT THIS TIME.

He’s proud of this moment and is acting “stupid” to cover it up. He’s a waist of oxygen.
Lot of misleading news, including from Mark Levin, about Trumps “Due Process” comment. They left out that he said “like in this crazy man’s case”. Meaning if you post on facebook that you want to shoot up a school, called the cops on yourself, and the cops are at your house daily	@1776Stonewall Yes. It's probable cause. And it's part of due process.

It wasn’t an auto weapon used in Parkland. It’s the assault rifle itself or whatever nomenclature you wanna give, it’s still a high powered weapon meant for killing, not sport

@John2261 @Hertz @NRA @enterprisecares @Avis Enterprise went against the NRA as well #BoycottEnterprise #BoycottHertz	@1patobello @John2261 @Hertz @NRA @enterprisecares @Avis Looks like you guys will be boycotting all car rental companies. Maybe you can hitch a ride on your AR-15 — the way a witch uses a broom!
Anyone notice that more &amp; more liberal cities/courts are refusing to follow the law? If libs take the house, they'll force their will upon us. We're almost there now.  Daring Florida to oust them, city commissioners pursue their own ban on assault rifles https://t.co/CyZcJ6YrXq	@1GigiSims I agree!  Don't Tread On Me USA Shirts!

Disgusting display for the #FakeNews cameras... ARM AND TRAIN TEACHERS TO STOP SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. https://t.co/q0PYQWuFsc	@1ClickBiz @nobamanoway #WednesdayWisdom #WednesdayMotivation #GunReformNow #GunControlNow #guncontrol #Trump #MAGA #FoxNews #CNN #MSNBC  If a would be school shooter knew that there were multiple unidentified staff who are trained and have quick access to secured firearms they would not even try. https://t.co/7egGceuPsU
Russia interferes in every election. You didn’t care until you were told to care. Statues stood for over 100 years. You didn’t care until you were told to care. People are killed daily by guns in cities like Chicago. You don’t care about gun violence until you’re told to care	@1776Stonewall @need4truthiness Until 2016, Russia had never manipulated a US election, attempts to remove statues has been on-going for years, support for gun control has never waivered, but faced w/chokehold #NRA has on Country via ownership of @GOP, reality of passage until end of @GOP control was a given.
#bumpstocks were made legal during the Obama Administration. isn't that ironic? And it is used by gangs like MS13. So if Trump gets rid of them, he will have done more than Obama did in 8 years. I'm sure the mislead kids in the rallies don't know that though.	@1776Stonewall @batmans_chic Obama tried to pass many gun regulations during his tenure. Bump stocks got through because they, as opposed by other devices, didn't alter the interworking of guns. So keep reading and quit saying nonsensical information.
Isn't it amazing that the liberals at the CNN Town Hall attacked Dana Loesch, who has absolutely nothing to do with the shooting, but gave the Broward County Sheriff, a man who was directly responsible for their friends/family death,  a round of applauds?	@1776Stonewall It's truly mind blowing. I mean they went after @DLoesch like pitbulls for NOTHING. #NRA has zero to do with Parkland. And this #BrowardCoward Sherriff gets a pass when he messed up at every level...ignored 23-40 calls, cops stood down and wouldn't let EMT inside school. 🤦
https://t.co/dB9O7XsRTj The #NRA is being unfairly attacked, for no reason at all. They have nothing to do with anything. they're being used as a liberal strawman. Show support and sign up today. Help fight the Democrat domestic terrorists	@1776Stonewall @McGillGail https://t.co/zR4IgEJnkb
Rush Limbaugh had a great session on how Democrats use children after a tragedy, who are already brainwashed liberals, and give the grieving kids a platform to speak out, and insist that politics stay out of it. but of course what the kids have to say is pure liberal propaganda	And they do it in a way that you can NEVER disagree with the grieving children, and if you do, than you are a disgusting insensitive sub-human. So We must listen to the children here - the children who are completely brainwashed liberals to begin with
Lot of misleading news, including from Mark Levin, about Trumps “Due Process” comment. They left out that he said “like in this crazy man’s case”. Meaning if you post on facebook that you want to shoot up a school, called the cops on yourself, and the cops are at your house daily	@1776Stonewall Gotta have an impound weapons from Mentally Hatefilled &amp; Unstable when police are continually called; Domestic violence, juvinelle even more so! If they prove through due process the charges were false, they get them back. Red Flag Juvinelle violence. I am 2A! System/People Fail
#BoycottNRA ????? You have to be a member you idiots.	@1776Stonewall FYI, thanks for keeping the trend going by using #BoycottNRA , Idiot!
WATCH: Speech on Guns by Virginia Senate Candidate Causes Democrat Walk-Out, Goes Massively Viral Online https://t.co/JyhWb7I9Qz	@2christian Very well organized &amp; delivered. The real problem is that his speech is only reaching the choir. The others simply won’t listen. Very few on the left will actively listen to reason, facts &amp; statistics. The left just relies on drama, MSM, regurgitated narratives &amp; hyperbole. #2A
I just got censored and slapped with a 3 day no posting no messaging from #facebook for this pic.  #censorship #truth #thestorm #greatawakening #parkland   All my post said was wow, crisis actors at parkland smh Wake up America!! social media is all part of this  @antischool_ftw https://t.co/1DPLeySUKJ	@13unicornkisses @antischool_ftw Trust their is So much Info out their these kids Must be exposed No Mercy ! @DestroyIllusion @allidoisowen @JamesOKeefeIII @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @Education4Libs #FalseFlag #CrisisActor #SchoolShootings #NeverAgain @seanhannity @jerome_corsi 🔻🔻🔻🔥 https://t.co/L4KqxJOd6N
Student Marchers now chanting we are not afraid of the NRA! Isn't it funny how we are told that it's not political, but they are pushing liberal talking points. These kids are so misled and have their heads filled with so many lies. The NRA literally has nothing to do with it	@1776Stonewall @rizzio123 Kids only know what their told!! Lib #parents  tell them the #NRA is the problem! So out of touch!
Fedex refuses to cut ties with the #NRA, even up against pressure from mislead liberals. . you better believe that Fedex will be targeted because of this. They'll probably be trending soon. . So if you have a package to mail, Fedex is a good choice. This shows strength	@1776Stonewall @wee_the_people Really? @FedEx would neuter #2A FedEx views assault rifles and large capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused. We therefore support restricting them to the military.
